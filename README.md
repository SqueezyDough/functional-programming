## Description
This app presents different types of data inside a bubble chart/map.
The bubble chart supports all kinds of data as long it only contains a name and a amount property. 
Users can click on a pre-selected category and display method. The chart will update accordingly.

## Data
I request data from the [National museum of world cultures](http://collectie.wereldculturen.nl/#/query/5de27531-1d92-4ca6-af75-f3d88e5a0f73). I only need to count the amount of types in a specific country.
